The phenomenon is commonly seen in a spinning toy top, but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the speed of the rotation and the magnitude of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at right angles to the direction that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the normal force (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on\nDocument 3: Rotation. A rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation. A three-dimensional object can always be rotated around an infinite number of imaginary lines called \"rotation axes\" ( ). If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity. The axis is called a pole.\nDocument 4: Rotation around a fixed axis. of the center of mass. There remains the matter of describing the rotation of the body about the center of mass and relating it to the external forces acting on the body.

Any point in the rolling object farther from the axis than the point of contact will temporarily move opposite to the direction of the overall motion when it is below the level of the rolling surface (for example,\n\n\nQuestion: an object that moves around an external axis is said to be</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",

Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse On March 15, 2018, a , recently-made section of the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity pedestrian bridge collapsed onto the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41), resulting in six deaths, eight injuries, and eight vehicles being crushed underneath. The initial construction on the pedestrian bridge was located in front of the campus of FIU in University Park, a suburb west of Miami, Florida, United States, and was in the process of post-tension rod adjustment when it suddenly failed.

A straight line drawn from part of an object to the corresponding part of its image makes a right angle with, and is bisected by, the surface of the plane mirror. The image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual (meaning that the light rays do not actually come from the image), upright, and of the same shape and size as the object it is reflecting. A virtual image is a copy of an object formed at the location from which the light rays\nDocument 2: Retroreflector. glowing). The combination of the eye's lens and the cornea form the refractive converging system, while the tapetum lucidum behind the retina forms the spherical concave mirror. Because the function of the eye is to form an image on the retina, an eye focused on a distant object has a focal surface that approximately follows the reflective tapetum lucidum structure, which is the condition required to form a good retroreflection. This type of retroreflector can consist of many small versions of these structures incorporated in a thin sheet or in paint. In the case of paint containing glass beads,\nDocument 3: Real image. Real images can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses, only if the object is placed further away from the mirror/lens than the focal point and this real image is inverted. As the object approaches the focal point the image approaches infinity, and when the object passes the focal point the image becomes virtual and is not inverted. The distance is not the same as from the object to the lenses.\nDocument 4: History of the telescope. 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccol\u00f2 Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book \"Optica philosophia\" of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the\nDocument 5: Curved mirror. with the behavior described above. For concave mirrors, whether the image is virtual or real depends on how large the object distance is compared to the focal length. If the formula_9 term is larger than the formula_7 term, formula_8 is positive and the image is real. Otherwise, the term is negative and the image is virtual. Again, this validates the behavior described above. The magnification of a mirror is defined as the height of the image divided by the height of the object: By convention, if the resulting magnification is positive, the image is upright.

In many cases, denaturation is reversible (the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed). This process can be called renaturation. This understanding has led to the notion that all the information needed for proteins to assume their native state was encoded in the primary structure of the protein, and hence in the DNA that codes for the protein, the so-called \"Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis\".

Coleman Bridge (Windsor, Massachusetts) Coleman Bridge is a historic Ball-patent pipe pony truss bridge in Windsor, Massachusetts. It is the only known surviving \"in situ\" bridge of its type, one of about two dozen built in western New England. It is located on an abandoned stretch of Windsor Bush Road which crosses Phelps Brook in what is now a remote upland section of Windsor. The bridge was located near farms owned by the Coleman family, giving the bridge its name. The bridge type was invented by Charles H. Ball, an entrepreneur from nearby Peru who developed\nDocument 2: Great Bridge (Cambridge). Great Bridge (Cambridge) The Great Bridge over the Charles River connected Cambridge, Massachusetts, to what is now known as Allston, Boston, Massachusetts. The Great Bridge was built in 1660\u20131662 at what was then called Brighton Street, and was the first bridge to span the Charles. A toll was authorized in 1670. The bridge was rebuilt in 1862. The Great Bridge was at the site of the modern-day Anderson Memorial Bridge, which connects John F. Kennedy Street in Cambridge to North Harvard Street in Allston.\nDocument 3: Charles Bridge. The bridge is long and nearly wide, following the example of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two on the Lesser Quarter side (including the Mal\u00e1 Strana Bridge Tower) and one on the Old Town side, the Old Town Bridge Tower. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.\nDocument 4: St. Charles Air Line Bridge.

The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.

The five-dimensional theory developed in three steps. The original hypothesis came from Theodor Kaluza, who sent his results to Einstein in 1919, and published them in 1921, which detailed a purely classical extension of general relativity to five dimensions and includes 15 components.

IZUMO1 Izumo sperm-egg fusion 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IZUMO1 gene. In mammalian fertilisation, IZUMO1 binds to its egg receptor counterpart, Juno, to facilitate recognition and fusion of the gametes. Section:Function. The sperm-specific protein Izumo, named for a Japanese shrine dedicated to marriage, is essential for sperm-egg plasma membrane binding and fusion. Studies have shown that male Izumo knockout mice are sterile because their sperm are unable to fuse to the oocyte membrane.[1] Izumo -/- mice produced morphologically normal sperm that were able to penetrate the zona pellucida, but could not fuse with\nDocument 2: Fertilisation. vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of actin to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the acrosomal process. The sperm binds to the egg through another ligand reaction between receptors on the vitelline membrane. The sperm surface protein bindin, binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1. Fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. At the site of contact, fusion causes the formation of a fertilisation cone. Section:Fertilisation in animals.:Mammals. Mammals internally fertilise through copulation. After a male ejaculates, many sperm move to the\nDocument 3: Human fertilization. Human fertilization\nDocument 4: Fusion mechanism. these cells must be primed to gain fusion-competence. Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid that usually resides on the inner layer of the cell membrane. After sperm cells are primed, phosphatidylserine can be found on the outer leaflet of the membrane. It is thought that this helps stabilize the membrane at the head of the sperm, and that it may play a role in allowing the sperm to enter the zona pellucida which covers egg cells. This unusual location of phosphatidylserine is an example of membrane restructuring during priming for cell fusion. Section:Mammalian Cell Fusion Mechanisms.:Chemotaxis.

There is also an empty 3d level, but it is at considerably higher energy than 3s and 3p (unlike in the hydrogen atom), so that 3s 3p is still considered a closed shell for chemical purposes.

Horace Dobbins had the exclusive idea of incorporating an elevated tollway for bicycles and other horseless vehicles from the Green Hotel in Pasadena to Los Angeles. This idea was brought to mind on 23 August 1897. Dobbins personally secured the right of way for six miles and the completed route was almost nine miles long.\nDocument 2: James A. Long. James A. Long James A. Long (27 August 1898 in York, Pennsylvania, United States \u2013 19 July 1971 in California, USA) was a theosophist and president of the Theosophical Society Pasadena. His election for president of the TS Pasadena was very controversial. As a result, some Theosophical Societies left the TS Pasadena to form the TS Point Loma-Covina. James Long founded the theosophical journal Sunrise (magazine). He also endeavored to enlarge the \"Theosophical Library Center\". He was succeeded by Grace F.

In a geostatic model, the movement of the star would have to be taken as \"real\" with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars. Stellar parallax is most often measured using annual parallax, defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i. e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

In order to use this method of calculating distance, two measurements are made of a star, one each at opposite sides of the Earth's orbit about the Sun. The star's position relative to the more distant background stars will appear displaced. The distance, formula_1 is found from the following equation, Where formula_3 is the parallax, measured in units of arc-seconds. Section:Distance.:Dynamical parallax.

Parallax () is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.

Stellar parallax is so difficult to detect that its existence was the subject of much debate in astronomy for hundreds of years. It was first observed in 1806 by Giuseppe Calandrelli who reported parallax in \u03b1-Lyrae in his work \"\"Osservazione e riflessione sulla parallasse annua dall\u2019alfa della Lira\"\". Then in 1838 Friedrich Bessel made the first successful parallax measurement, for the star 61 Cygni, using a Fraunhofer heliometer at K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory.

In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001\u20132002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.

Fat Fats are one of the three main macronutrients, along with carbohydrates and proteins. Fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.

By 1985, a version for the IBM PC existed called PC-BLIS. Originally, most operating systems were written in assembly language for a particular processor or family of processors. Non-assembler operating systems were comparatively slow, but were easier for revision and repair. One of the reasons for the C programming language's low-level features, which resemble assembly language in some ways, is an early intent to use it for writing operating systems. Similar goals led to IBM's development of PL/S.

An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world. Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the\nDocument 3: Geocentric model.

The Lubavitcher Rebbe also explained that geocentrism is defensible based on the theory of Relativity, which establishes that \"when two bodies in space are in motion relative to one another, ... science declares with absolute certainty that from the scientific point of view both possibilities are equally valid, namely that the Earth revolves around the sun, or the sun revolves around the Earth\", although he also went on to refer to people who believed in geocentrism as \"remaining in the world\nDocument 5: Geocentric model. contrast to the older flat-Earth model implied in some mythology.

In biochemistry, allosteric regulation (or allosteric control) is the regulation of a protein by binding an effector molecule at a site other than the enzyme's active site. The site to which the effector binds is termed the \"allosteric site\". Allosteric sites allow effectors to bind to the protein, often resulting in a conformational change involving protein dynamics. Effectors that enhance the protein's activity are referred to as \"allosteric activators\", whereas those that decrease the protein's activity are called \"allosteric inhibitors\". Allosteric regulations are a natural example of control loops, such as feedback from downstream products or feedforward from\nDocument 2: Allosteric enzyme. or less active by redistributing the ensemble between the higher affinity and lower affinity states. The binding sites for heterotropic effectors, called allosteric sites, are usually separate from the active site yet thermodynamically coupled.

This \"action at a distance\" through binding of one ligand affecting the binding of another at a distinctly different site, is the essence of the allosteric concept. Allostery plays a crucial role in many fundamental biological processes, including but not limited to cell signaling and the regulation of metabolism.

Allosteric modification usually happens in proteins with more than one subunit. Allosteric interactions are often present in metabolic pathways and are beneficial in that they allow one step of a reaction to regulate another step. They allow an enzyme to have a range of molecular interactions, other than the highly specific active site. Section:See also.

Medullary ischemic reflex The medullary ischemic reflex is a big response to a drop in blood pressure in the brain particularly in the medulla, where the lack of oxygen due to decreased perfusion triggers an autonomic response from the cardiac and vasomotor centers. The cardiac and vasomotor centers respond to the decrease in blood pressure with sympathetic outflow to the heart and blood vessels. This outflow causes increased heart rate and force of contraction, as well as bodywide vasoconstriction. Together these responses increase blood pressure and perfusion rate to the brain, ending the feedback loop.\nDocument 2: Arthur D. Hirschfelder. Another function of aconite is to diminish the size and force of cardiac contractions while accelerating the heart, and the third function of aconite is to stimulate the vasomotor center. This drug, however, lowers the activity of the respiratory center and may cause dyspnoea, shortness of breath. Section:Medicine.:Research.:Aconite.:Adrenaline. Adrenaline was found to raise the blood-pressure by constricting the peripheral blood-vessels and stimulating the heart.

The vasomotor center (VMC) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that, together with the cardiovascular center and respiratory center, regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes. Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure (\"center\") but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons. Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors, it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels. This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation, especially in the brain. Cranial nerves IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the\nDocument 4: Coprinopsis atramentaria. of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover; its effect on autonomic \u03b2 receptors is responsible for the vasomotor symptoms.

Section:Criticism. Perhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell's. He maintained that since both a belief and its negation will, individually, cohere with at least one set of beliefs, this means that contradictory beliefs can be shown to be true according to coherence theory, and therefore that the theory cannot work. However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs,\nDocument 2: Coherentism. sets of beliefs to be internally coherent. Thus there might be several such sets. But if one supposes\u2014in line with the principle of non-contradiction\u2014that there can only be \"one\" complete set of truths, coherentism must therefore resolve internally that these systems are not contradictory, by establishing what is meant by truth. At this point, Coherence could be faulted for adopting its own variation of dogmatic foundationalism by arbitrarily selecting truth values. Coherentists must argue that their truth-values are not arbitrary for provable reasons. A second objection also emerges, the \"finite problem\": that arbitrary, ad hoc relativism could reduce statements\nDocument 3: Ideology.

Since both cotenability and supportiveness are matters of degree, coherence is too.\" Usually the system of belief is taken to be the complete set of beliefs of the individual or group, that is, their theory of the world. It is necessary for coherentism to explain in some detail what it means for a system to be coherent. At the least, coherence must include logical consistency. It also usually requires some degree of integration of the various components of the system.

These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so. Darwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a\nDocument 2: Leo Klejn. built on the basis of socio-biology. Developing the ideas of Lorenz and Desmond Morris, Klejn's idea is built upon the fact that in every stage of man's biological evolution man has been formed by adaptation to conditions not only of the natural environment but also of the socio-cultural milieu. However tempos of socio-cultural evolution are much faster than those of biological evolution: socio-cultural evolution has no need to wait for generations to change. While biological evolution has not terminated even a single stage of homo sapiens, socio-cultural evolution has gone through the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Eneolithic, Neolithic, Bronze\nDocument 3: History of evolutionary thought. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was\nDocument 4: Culture and social cognition.

Cultural cognitive evolution proposes that humans\u2019 unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and great apes are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution.

Dawkins wrote that evolution depended not on the particular chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission\u2014in the case of biological evolution, the gene. For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution. Although Dawkins invented the term 'meme' and developed meme theory, the possibility that ideas were subject to the same pressures of evolution as were biological attributes was discussed in Darwin's time.

The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), colloquially the Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876. Originally described in a four-page pamphlet, it has been expanded to multiple volumes and revised through 23 major editions, the latest printed in 2011. It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries. OCLC, a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries, currently maintains the system and licenses online access to WebDewey, a continuously updated version for catalogers.\nDocument 4: Dewey Decimal Classification. of this same title. Dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for the second edition. In an introduction to that edition Dewey states that \"nearly 100 persons hav [spelling of 'have' per English-language spelling reform, which Dewey championed] contributed criticisms and suggestions\". One of the innovations of the Dewey Decimal system was that of positioning books on the shelves in relation to other books on similar topics.

Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of\n\n\nQuestion: where did the dewey decimal system come from</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",

This layer is mainly made up of endothelial cells (and a supporting layer of elastin rich collagen in elastic arteries). The hollow internal cavity in which the blood flows is called the lumen. Section:Structure.:Development. Arterial formation begins and ends when endothelial cells begin to express arterial specific genes, such as ephrin B2. Section:Function. Arteries form part of the circulatory system. They carry blood that is oxygenated after it has been pumped from the heart. Coronary arteries also aid the heart in pumping blood by sending oxygenated blood\nDocument 2: Pump. (or physical occlusions) are present to regulate the flow direction. The fluid pumping efficiency of a valveless system, however, is not necessarily lower than that having valves. In fact, many fluid-dynamical systems in nature and engineering more or less rely upon valveless pumping to transport the working fluids therein. For instance, blood circulation in the cardiovascular system is maintained to some extent even when the heart\u2019s valves fail. Meanwhile, the embryonic vertebrate heart begins pumping blood long before the development of discernible chambers and valves. In microfluidics, valveless impedance pumps have been fabricated, and are expected to be particularly\nDocument 3: Heart development. Heart development (also known as cardiogenesis) refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the \"primitive heart tube\", that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.\nDocument 4: Tafazzin. blood clots. Section:Clinical significance.:Isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium (INVM). Mutations in the \"TAZ\" gene can cause a heart condition called isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium (INVM). This condition occurs when the lower left chamber of the heart (left ventricle) does not develop correctly. In INVM, the heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump blood efficiently. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can also occur. INVM frequently causes heart failure. Section:Clinical significance.:Cancer. Additionally, TAZ has been found to be highly expressed in gastric cancer cells resistant to cisplatin. This resistance was identified to be due to the acquired ability of\nDocument 5: Heart development. two separate angiogenic cell clusters form on either side and coalesce to form the endocardial tubes. As embryonic folding continues, the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days. At around 18 to 19 days after fertilisation, the heart begins to form. This early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22.

Some of the most important debates in the history of scientific method center on: rationalism, especially as advocated by Ren\u00e9 Descartes; inductivism, which rose to particular prominence with Isaac Newton and his followers; and hypothetico-deductivism, which came to the fore in the early 19th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a debate over realism vs. antirealism was central to discussions of scientific method as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable, while in the mid-20th century some prominent philosophers argued against any universal rules of science at all.\nDocument 4: Inductive reasoning. severe skepticism, Hume advocated a practical skepticism based on common sense, where the inevitability of induction is accepted.

A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a \"condyle\", \"crest\", \"spine\", \"eminence\", \"tubercle\" or \"tuberosity\", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, long bones are said to have a \"head\", \"neck\", and \"body\".\nDocument 2: Nasal septum. length of the septum. This strip of bone is called the maxillary crest, and it articulates in front with the quadrangular cartilage, and at the back with the vomer. The maxillary crest is described in the anatomy of the nasal septum as having a maxillary component and a palatine component. Section:Structure.:Development. At an early period the septum of the nose consists of a plate of cartilage, known as the ethmovomerine cartilage. The postero-superior part of this cartilage is ossified to form the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; its antero-inferior portion persists as the septal cartilage, while the vomer\nDocument 3: Alveolar process. The alveolar process contains a region of compact bone adjacent to the periodontal ligament (PDL), called the lamina dura when viewed on radiographs. It is this part which is attached to the cementum of the roots by the periodontal ligament. It is uniformly radiopaque (or lighter). Integrity of the lamina dura is important when studying radiographs for pathological lesions.\nDocument 4: Dental radiography. Dental radiography Dental radiographs are commonly called X-rays. Dentists use radiographs for many reasons: to find hidden dental structures, malignant or benign masses, bone loss, and cavities. A radiographic image is formed by a controlled burst of X-ray radiation which penetrates oral structures at different levels, depending on varying anatomical densities, before striking the film or sensor. Teeth appear lighter because less radiation penetrates them to reach the film. Dental caries, infections and other changes in the bone density, and the periodontal ligament, appear darker because X-rays readily penetrate these less dense structures. Dental restorations (fillings, crowns) may\nDocument 5: Bone bed. Bone bed A bone bed is any geological stratum or deposit that contains bones of whatever kind. Inevitably, such deposits are sedimentary in nature. Not a formal term, it tends to be used more to describe especially dense collections such as Lagerst\u00e4tte. It is also applied to brecciated and stalagmitic deposits on the floor of caves, which frequently contain osseous remains. In a more restricted sense, the term is used to describe certain thin layers of bony fragments, which occur in well-defined geological strata. One of the best-known of these is the Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found\n\n\nQuestion: the radiographic term used to describe the dense bone of the socket and septal crest is</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",

Section:Terminology. In biblical Hebrew, the Ten Commandments are called (transliterated ) and in Mishnaic Hebrew (transliterated ), both translatable as \"the ten words\", \"the ten sayings\", or \"the ten matters\". The Tyndale and Coverdale English biblical translations used \"ten verses\". The Geneva Bible used \"tenne commandements\", which was followed by the Bishops' Bible and the Authorized Version (the \"King James\" version) as \"ten commandments\". Most major English versions use \"commandments.\" The English name \"Decalogue\" is derived from Greek\nDocument 2: Internal consistency of the Bible. in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mount Gerizim, and says plainly that Mount Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered.

The Ten Commandments (, \"Aseret ha'Dibrot\"), also known as the Decalogue, are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship, which play a fundamental role in the Abrahamic religions. The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Hebrew Bible, in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The commandments include instructions to worship only God, to honour one's parents, and to keep the sabbath day holy, as well as prohibitions against idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, theft, dishonesty, and coveting. Different religious groups follow different traditions for interpreting and numbering them.\nDocument 4: Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics. Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics were created in 1992 by the Computer Ethics Institute. The commandments were introduced in the paper \"In Pursuit of a 'Ten Commandments' for Computer Ethics\" by Ramon C. Barquin as a means to create \"a set of standards to guide and instruct people in the ethical use of computers.\" They follow the Internet Advisory Board's memo on ethics from 1987. The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics copies the archaic style of the Ten Commandments from the King James Bible.

The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition. The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches, and in the first half of the 20th century, kudzu was distributed as a high-protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion.

List of earthquakes in Mexico This is a partial list of earthquakes in Mexico. This list considers every notable earthquake felt or with its epicenter within Mexico's current borders and maritime areas. Section:Geology. Mexico lies within two seismically active earthquake zones. The Baja California peninsula lies near the boundary of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, while southern Mexico lies just north of the boundary between the North American Plate and the Cocos and Rivera tectonic plates. The Cocos Plate is subducting under the North American Plate at a rate of per year,\nDocument 2: 2014 Guerrero earthquake. 2014 Guerrero earthquake The 2014 Guerrero earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 7.2 that hit the state of Guerrero, close to Acapulco, Mexico, on 18 April at 14:27:26. The epicenter occurred 265 kilometers southwest of Mexico City and at a depth of 24 kilometers. Thrust motion at shallow depths is what caused the earthquake. This was broadly consistent with a slip on or near the Guerrero Seismic Gap, a boundary between the Cocos and North American plates along the Pacific Coast approximately 200 kilometers long. The shaking was felt in states as far away as Puebla\nDocument 3: 2017 Puebla earthquake. Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions, sitting atop several intersecting tectonic plates. The border between the Cocos Plate and North American Plate, along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, creates a subduction zone that generates large seismic events. Activity along the edges of the Rivera and Caribbean plates also generate seismic events. All together, these seismic forces cause an average of 40 earthquakes a day in Mexico.\nDocument 4: Interplate earthquake. drop which occurs after the earthquake also differentiate the two types of events. Intraplate earthquakes have, on average, a higher stress drop than that of an interplate earthquake and generally higher intensity. Section:Mechanics. Mechanically, interplate earthquakes differ from other seismic events in that they are caused by motion at the boundary between two tectonic plates. An interplate earthquake event occurs when the accumulated stress at a tectonic plate boundary are released via brittle failure and displacement along the fault. There are three types of plate boundaries to consider in the context of interplate earthquake events: Section:Mechanics.:Precursory tremors.

It caused a large tsunami that affected the coast of the Puebla Intendancy (includes the current state of Guerrero) and the Oaxaca Intendancy (currently Oaxaca) in Southwestern New Spain (in currently boundary of Mexico). With an estimated magnitude of 8.6 on the moment magnitude scale, it was more powerful than any instrumentally recorded Mexican earthquake. Section:Tectonic setting.

Group 11 is also known as the \"coinage metals\", due to their former usage. They were most likely the first three elements discovered. Copper, silver, and gold all occur naturally in elemental form.\nDocument 4: Period 5 element.

Section:Light-dependent reactions.:Z scheme. In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem\nDocument 2: Hill reaction. is released requires light; therefore the Hill reaction can be described as the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis. The reaction in which oxygen is released takes place within the chloroplast of plants and the Hill reaction demonstrated that the release of oxygen (O) is only a partial reaction which requires one step of photosynthesis. The Hill reaction implies that the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis is a result of a series of redox reactions and a suitable terminal electron acceptor is required for that reaction to occur. Plants have natural electron acceptors such as NADP, that play a\nDocument 3: Light-dependent reactions. In photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem II (PSII), Cytochrome b6f complex, Photosystem I (PSI), and ATP synthase. These four complexes work together to ultimately create the products ATP and NADPH.\nDocument 4: Stroma (fluid). Stroma (fluid) Stroma, in botany, refers to the colorless fluid surrounding the grana within the chloroplast. Within the stroma are grana, stacks of thylakoid, the sub-organelles, the daughter cells, where photosynthesis is commenced before the chemical changes are completed in the stroma. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, \"light-dependent reactions\" capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the \"light-independent reactions\" use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. The series of biochemical redox reactions which take place in the stroma are\nDocument 5: Photosynthesis. for this process is: This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling \"n\" water molecules from each side gives the net equation: Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate: The equation for this reaction is: Photosynthesis occurs in two stages.

The Princess Bride is a 1987 American fantasy adventure comedy film directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner, starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Christopher Guest. Adapted by William Goldman from his 1973 novel \"The Princess Bride\", it tells the story of a farmhand named Westley, accompanied by companions befriended along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck. The film essentially preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk)\nDocument 4: The Princess Bride (film). it became a cult classic after its release to the home video market. The film is widely regarded as eminently quotable. Elwes noted in 2017, on the film's 30th anniversary, that fans still frequently come up to him and quote lines from the movie. According to him Wallace Shawn had it \"worse\", in that any time Wallace made a small error like dropping his keys, people would shout \"Inconceivable!\" to him.

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of bryophytes, rhizoids in nonvascular plants, and the roots, leaves, and other organs found in tracheophytes (vascular plants).

Although cyanobacteria are often referred to as \"blue-green algae\", most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae.

The two nuclei contained in the apical part of each hypha divide in such a way that the threads of their mitotic spindles run parallel, creating two pairs of genetically different nuclei. One daughter nucleus migrates close to the hook, while the other daughter nucleus locates to the basal part of the hypha. The formation of two parallel cross-walls then divides the hypha into three sections: one at the hook with one nucleus, one at the basal of the original hypha that\nDocument 2: Ascomycota. from the two hyphae form pairs, initiating the \"dikaryophase\" of the sexual cycle, during which time the pairs of nuclei synchronously divide. Fusion of the paired nuclei leads to mixing of the genetic material and recombination and is followed by meiosis. A similar sexual cycle is present in the red algae (Rhodophyta). A discarded hypothesis held that a second karyogamy event occurred in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny, resulting in a tetraploid nucleus which divided into four diploid nuclei by meiosis and then into eight haploid nuclei by a supposed process called brachymeiosis, but this hypothesis was disproven in\nDocument 3: Mitosis. In cell biology, mitosis () is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell\nDocument 4: Chromosome. structure of chromosomes varies through the cell cycle. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their progeny.

Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called chromatids or sister chromatids) joined by a centromere.

Mithridatism Mithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity. Section:Background. Mithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning, said to be at his mother's orders. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus until a male heir came of age.

It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim \"All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.\" This is often condensed to: \"The dose makes the poison\" or in Latin, . It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e.,\nDocument 4: Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. polonium-210, a poisonous radioactive isotope.

Section:Basic principles. The goal of toxicity assessment is to identify adverse effects of a substance. Adverse effects depend on two main factors: i) routes of exposure (oral, inhalation, or dermal) and ii) dose (duration and concentration of exposure). To explore dose, substances are tested in both acute and chronic models. Generally, different sets of experiments are conducted to determine whether a substance\n\n\nQuestion: who said the poison is in the dose</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",

Relief Act of 1997, a reconciliation bill that reduced taxes and increased the federal budget deficit. The tax cut bill was paired with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which reduced spending, and the two bills were signed into law by President Clinton. In 1999, the Congress used reconciliation to pass the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act 1999, which represented the first time that the reconciliation process was used to increase deficits without a companion bill that reduced spending. It was vetoed by President Clinton. A similar situation happened in 2000, when the Senate again used\nDocument 3: United States budget process. There is no obligation for either or both houses of Congress to pass a budget resolution. There may not be a resolution every year; if none is established, the previous year's resolution remains in force. For example, the Senate has not passed a budget resolution for FY2011, FY2012, or FY2013, and passed the FY2014 budget resolution on March 23, 2013, 23 days before the April 15 deadline set by the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013.

The fight-or-flight response (also called hyperarousal, or the acute stress response) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon. His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing.

When epinephrine is released it will bind to various receptors in various target organs; this will exhibit multiple roles in the fight or flight mechanism. The HPA system is responsible for producing glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex; the main glucocorticoid in humans is the steroid hormone cortisol. In contrast to epinephrine, which takes a short amount of time for production, cortisol takes up to 25 minutes to reach peak levels.

A 'hole', marked by significant drop in ozone molecules in the layer, as large as that of United States was discovered by a British team.

Reactions that take place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an important role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden Antarctic ozone hole was such a surprise to many scientists. It is more accurate to speak of ozone depletion in middle latitudes rather than holes. Total column ozone declined\nDocument 3: Ozone depletion. The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O) into oxygen (O). Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.\nDocument 4: Ozone depletion.

The main public concern regarding the ozone hole has been the effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If the high levels of depletion seen in the ozone hole were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more dramatic.

Bathynotus Bathynotus is a genus of trilobites of the family Bathynotidae. Its fossils have been found in the paleocontinents Laurentia (specifically in what are now Nevada and Vermont), Gondwana (in South China and South-Australia), and - doubtfully - Siberia. It is characterized by a very wide axis in the thorax and an enlarged 11th segment that bears a long, backwardly directed spine on each side. Additionally, the 12th and 13th segments are narrow and fuse with the edge of the spine of the 11th segment. Section:Etymology. \"Bathynotus\" is derived from the Greek words \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03c2 -bathus- meaning \"ample\"; and \u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\nDocument 2: Echinothurioida. one in the manner of tiles on a roof and this means the test is flexible.

Spinal fusion, also called spondylodesis or spondylosyndesis, is a neurosurgical or orthopedic surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae. This procedure can be performed at any level in the spine (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar) and prevents any movement between the fused vertebrae. There are many types of spinal fusion and each technique involves using bone grafting\u2014either from the patient (autograft), donor (allograft), or artificial bone substitutes\u2014to help the bones heal together. Additional hardware (screws, plates, or cages) is often used to hold the bones in place while the graft fuses the two vertebrae together.\nDocument 4: Sclerocormus. bear tall, vertical neural spines that are broadened so as to leave little space between each spine.

This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form.

In Europe megaliths are, in general, constructions erected during the Neolithic or late stone age and Chalcolithic or Copper Age (4500\u20131500 BC).

In a series of classifications proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators since 1981, Protozoa has been ranked as a kingdom.

The field of bacteriology (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded in the 19th century by Ferdinand Cohn, a botanist whose studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including \"Bacillus\" and \"Beggiatoa\". Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic classification of bacteria, and to discover endospores. Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch were contemporaries of Cohn, and are often considered to be the father of microbiology and medical microbiology, respectively.

In biology, taxonomy () is the science of naming, defining (circumscribing) and classifying groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are domain, kingdom, phylum (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum), class, order, family, genus, and species. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the founder of the current\nDocument 4: Chiton. flax or linen, and originally the Sumerian word \"gada\" or \"gida\". The Greek-derived name Polyplacophora comes from the words \"poly-\" (many), \"plako-\" (tablet), and \"-phoros\" (bearing), a reference to the chiton's eight shell plates. Section:Taxonomy. Most classification schemes in use today are based, at least in part, on Pilsbry's Manual of Conchology (1892\u20131894), extended and revised by Kaas and Van Belle (1985\u20131990). Since chitons were first described by Linnaeus (1758), extensive taxonomic studies at the species level have been made. However, the taxonomic classification at higher levels in the group has remained somewhat unsettled.

In the 2000s, Edelman created a front group called the Working Families for Wal-Mart, which said it was a grassroots organization, but was actually funded by Wal-Mart. It paid two bloggers to travel the country interviewing Wal-Mart employees, one of whom was a senior Edelman employee's sister. According to \"The New Yorker\", \"everyone she talked to was delighted with Wal-Mart\". In 2006, \"BusinessWeek\" reported that the public relations effort, which was positioned as a grassroots blog, was actually paid for by Wal-Mart. \"The New Yorker\" called it a \"blatant example of astroturfing\". In 2008 Edelman's work\nDocument 2: Labor spying in the United States. book \"The Case Against Wal-Mart\", author Al Norman cites many of the usual criticisms of the big box retail chain. He has written, Wal-Mart is so terrified of union organizing, the company allegedly monitors some of its stores' phone calls and emails. Jon Lehman, a former Wal-Mart store manager, told Bloomberg news in February 2004 that Wal-Mart has a 60\u00d760-foot room in Bentonville in which two dozen people with headsets conduct surveillance on calls and emails from stores, to see whether anyone is talking about union organizing.

Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome. This is not to be confused with mitosis. Mitosis also has prophase, but does not ordinarily do pairing of two homologous chromosomes. When the non-sister chromatids intertwine, segments of chromatids with similar sequence may break apart and be exchanged in a process known as genetic recombination or \"crossing-over\". This exchange produces a chiasma, a region that is shaped\nDocument 2: Chromosome segregation. of different parental origin (e.g. a paternal and a maternal set). During the phase of meiosis labeled \u201cinterphase s\u201d in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so that each of the chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis (see Synapsis). During synapsis, genetic recombination usually occurs. Some of the recombination events occur by crossing\nDocument 3: Synapsis. Synapsis (also called syndesis) is the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex. Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis, and are held together\nDocument 4: Synapsis. double-strand breaks appear to be initiation sites for meiotic silencing. Section:Recombination. In female \"Drosophila melanogaster\" fruit flies, meiotic chromosome synapsis occurs in the absence of recombination. Thus synapsis in \"Drosophila\" is independent of meiotic recombination, consistent with the view that synapsis is a precondition required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination is also unnecessary for homologous chromosome synapsis in the nematode \"Caenorhabditis elegans\".

In addition, as noted by Wilkins and Holliday, there are four novel steps needed in meiosis that are not present in mitosis. These are: (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2) extensive recombination between homologs; (3) suppression of sister chromatid separation in the first meiotic division; and (4) avoiding chromosome replication during the second meiotic division.

In the short and highly stereoselective synthesis of Retosiban 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave\nDocument 2: 2,5-Diketopiperazine. synthesis of 2,5-diketopiperazines 3 is amide bond formation by cyclisation of dipeptide 1 or 2. These dipeptides can be formed by coupling two amino acids together by the many methods of peptide synthesis or by using the Ugi reaction of an isonitrile, amino acid, aldehyde and amine, followed by deprotection. Dipeptides substituted with an amine at one terminus and an ester at the other 1 can spontaneously cyclize to form a 2,5-diketopiperazine at a range of pHs. However, careful selection of reaction conditions is required to limit racemization. This has been achieved in a general, efficient, and environmentally benign\nDocument 3: Dipeptide. For many amino acids, the ancillary functional groups are protected. The condensation of the amine and the carboxylic acid to form the peptide bond generally employs coupling agents to activate the carboxylic acid.\nDocument 4: Beta bend ribbon. types also occur. Type I beta-bend ribbons regularly occur in leucine-rich repeats, in the environments sometimes occupied by helices. A protein with a stack of these features is the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Nogo receptor. Another beta bend ribbon occurs in the GTPase-activating protein for Rho in the active, but not the inactive, form of the enzyme. The beta bend ribbon, which incorporates the catalytic arginine, allows its side-chain guanidino group to approach the active site and enhance enzyme activity.

This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione. In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.

Malonyl-CoA is an important metabolite in some parts of the cell. In peroxisomes, the accumulation of this substance causes malonic aciduria, a highly pathogenic disease. To avoid it malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) converts malonyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA through the following reaction: In the cytosol, malonyl-CoA can inhibit the entrance of fatty acids into the mitochondria and it can also act as a precursor for the fatty acids synthesis. Malonyl-CoA also plays an important role inside the mitochondria, where it is an intermediary\nDocument 5: Fatty-acyl-CoA synthase. alpha and beta subunits. The enzyme complex therefore consists of six functional centers for fatty acid synthesis. Section:Reaction. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction: Acetyl-CoA + n malonyl-CoA + 4n NADPH + 4n H formula_1 long-chain-acyl-CoA + n CoA + n CO + 4n NADP The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, NADPH, and H, whereas its 4 products are Acyl-CoA, CoA, CO, and NADP. More specifically, the FAS catalysis mechanism consumes an acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and seven malonyl-CoA molecules to produce a Palmitoyl-CoA. Section:Background.

Sulfate ion serves as a replacement for inorganic phosphate once the acylphosphate intermediate is formed inside the active site. Section:Mechanism. The biosynthetic mechanisms for synthetases use energy from nucleoside triphosphates, whereas synthases do not. Glutathione synthetase stays true to this rule, in that it uses the energy generated by ATP. Initially, the carboxylate group on \u03b3-glutamylcysteine is converted into an acyl phosphate by the transfer of an inorganic phosphate group of ATP to generate an acyl phosphate intermediate.\nDocument 3: ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis is the catabolic reaction process by which chemical energy that has been stored in the high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released by splitting these bonds, for example in muscles, by producing work in the form of mechanical energy. The product is adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate, orthophosphate (P). ADP can be further hydrolyzed to give energy, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and another orthophosphate (P).

However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell. Enzymes of the smooth ER can also help detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually involves the addition of a hydroxyl group to a\nDocument 5: Basal metabolic rate. in muscle contraction. This is what causes muscles to work which can require a breakdown, and also to build in the rest period, which occurs during the strengthening phase associated with muscular contraction. ATP is composed of adenine, a nitrogen containing base, ribose, a five carbon sugar (collectively called adenosine), and three phosphate groups. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups.

However, in recent years the importance of studying the structure and function of proinsulin in relation to these diseases has become increasingly clear. Section:Medical Relevance.:Diabetes Mellitus.

The post translational modification of proinsulin to mature insulin only occurs in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. When proinsulin is transported through the Golgi apparatus the C-peptide is cleaved. This cleavage occurs with the aid of two endoproteases. Type I endoproteases, PC1 and PC3, disrupt the C peptide-B chain connection. PC2, a type II endoprotease, cleaves the C peptide-A chain bond.

Due to the relative similarities in structure, proinsulin can produce between 5% and 10% of the metabolic activity similarly induced by insulin.

Steiner of the University of Chicago in 1967. Section:Structure. Proinsulin is made up of 81 residues (in cows, 86 in humans), and formed by three distinct chains.

The data rate is reduced to 48, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9 then 6 Mbit/s if required. 802.11a originally had 12/13 non-overlapping channels, 12 that can be used indoor and 4/5 of the 12 that can be used in outdoor point to\nDocument 2: IEEE 802.11n-2009. next generation standard.

IEEE 802.11n-2009 is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11-2007 wireless-networking standard. 802.11 is a set of IEEE standards that govern wireless networking transmission methods.

Section:Protocol.:802.11a (OFDM waveform). 802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an OFDM based air interface (physical layer). It operates in the 5 GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54 Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.

The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs.

Polyprotein synthesis, internal ribosome entry sites, and uncapped mRNA were all discovered by studying poliovirus infected cells, and a poliovirus clone was the first infectious DNA clone made of an RNA virus in animals. Along with rhinovirus, poliovirus was the first animal virus to have its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. RNA dependent RNA polymerase was discovered in \"Mengovirus\", a genus of picornaviruses. Section:Related Families. Within the order Picornavirales, there are related viral families, such as the plant infecting Secoviridae, and the insect infecting Dicistroviridae. Section:Related Families.:Secoviridae. The plant-infecting picorna-like viruses have a number of\nDocument 2: Harold Strachan. inspired by his reading of Robert Graves. He trained other operatives, who then disseminated the expertise through a clandestine cell system. His home-made bombs were planted at strategic infrastructure targets like electrical substations and railway lines. As far as is known, no lives were lost in these attacks. He was caught when one of his trainees planted an improperly constructed incendiary device in the magistrate's court in Butterworth. It failed to go off, was discovered, and the operative was traced by fingerprint evidence. When tortured by the police he revealed Strachan's address. Strachan was arrested at gunpoint and\nDocument 3: History of botany. In India simple artificial plant classification systems of the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical with the work of Parashara (c. 400 \u2013 c. 500 AD), the author of \"V\u1e5bksayurveda\" (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: \"Samiganiya\" (Fabaceae), \"Puplikagalniya\" (Rutaceae), \"Svastikaganiya\" (Cruciferae), \"Tripuspaganiya\" (Cucurbitaceae), \"Mallikaganiya\" (Apocynaceae), and \"Kurcapuspaganiya\" (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the \"Prthviniraparyam\" of Udayana, \"Nyayavindutika\" of Dharmottara, \"Saddarsana-samuccaya\"\nDocument 4: Cell (biology). species, it has been estimated that humans contain somewhere around 40 trillion (4\u00d710) cells. Most plant and animal cells are visible only under a microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres. Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come\nDocument 5: Phytoplasma. Phytoplasma Phytoplasmas are obligate bacterial parasites of plant phloem tissue and of the insect vectors that are involved in their plant-to-plant transmission. Phytoplasmas were discovered in 1967 by Japanese scientists who termed them mycoplasma-like organisms. Since their discovery, phytoplasmas have resisted all attempts at \"in vitro\" culture in any cell-free medium; routine cultivation in an artificial medium thus remains a major challenge. Although phytoplasmas have recently been reported to be grown in a specific artificial medium, experimental repetition has yet to be reported. Phytoplasmas are characterized by the lack of a cell wall, a pleiomorphic or filamentous shape, a\n\n\nQuestion: who discovered that plants were made of cells</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",
