An initialization vector has different security requirements than a key, so the IV usually does not need to be secret. However, in most cases, it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key. For CBC and CFB, reusing an IV leaks some information about the first block of plaintext, and\nDocument 5: Cluster Shared Volumes. VMs to be accessed off a common shared disk. CSV also increases the resiliency of the cluster by having I/O fault detection and recovery over alternate communication paths between the nodes in the cluster. While CSV is not required for Live Migration of VMs, it reduces the potential disconnection period at the end of the migration since the NTFS file system does not have to be unmounted/mounted as is the case with a traditional cluster disk.

Understeer and oversteer Understeer and oversteer are vehicle dynamics terms used to describe the sensitivity of a vehicle to steering. Oversteer is what occurs when a car turns (steers) by more than the amount commanded by the driver. Conversely, understeer is what occurs when a car steers less than the amount commanded by the driver. Automotive engineers define understeer and oversteer based on changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration over a sequence of steady-state circular turning tests. Car and motorsport enthusiasts often use the terminology more generally in magazines and blogs to describe\nDocument 2: Drifting (motorsport). Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction in only the rear wheels, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).

Lift-off oversteer is often exploited in motorsportparticularly on loose surfaces (e.g. in rallying)as a method of cornering faster as, when controlled, it has the effect of turning the nose into the apex and the car slightly sideways which allows early application of power on exiting the corner. Formula One driver Jim Clark's late-braking technique exploited the lift-off oversteer characteristics of mid-engined race cars to attain higher cornering speeds.

Since 1252 the region was under the rule of various German governments, starting with the Teutonic Knights and later Prussia and Germany. Already in 1569 a \"confusion of languages\" was noticed: German, Lithuanian, Latvian-Curonian (Nehrungs-Kurisch) and Prussian. Nehrungs-kurisch was the language of the fishers.

He published translations of English pornography into French and vice versa for English publishers such as Edward Avery. He also published work of the Decadent movement such as \"Monsieur V\u00e9nus\" by Rachilde. He was already under investigation by the police in 1885, 1886 and 1888 and moved to Antwerp in 1894: in 1895 another police dossier was compiled.\nDocument 2: Decadent movement. The Decadent movement was a late-19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe, that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist F\u00e9licien Rops's body of work and Joris-Karl Huysmans's novel \"Against Nature\" (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States. The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world.\nDocument 3: Evelyne Brancart.

Caesium-137 Caesium-137 (), or radiocaesium, is a radioactive isotope of caesium which is formed as one of the more common fission products by the nuclear fission of uranium-235 and other fissionable isotopes in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Trace quantities also originate from natural fission of uranium-238. It is among the most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of caesium's most common chemical compounds, which are salts. Section:Decay. Caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30.17 years. About 94.6% decays by beta emission to a metastable\nDocument 2: Hyperaccumulators table \u2013 3. This list covers hyperaccumulators, plant species which accumulate, or are tolerant of radionuclides (Cd, Cs-137, Co, Pu-238, Ra, Sr, U-234, 235, 238), hydrocarbons and organic solvents (Benzene, BTEX, DDT, Dieldrin, Endosulfan, Fluoranthene, MTBE, PCB, PCNB, TCE and by-products), and inorganic solvents (Potassium ferrocyanide).\nDocument 3: Radium. production of pure radium compounds is only about 100 g in total today. The chief radium-producing countries are Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The amounts of radium produced were and are always relatively small; for example, in 1918, 13.6 g of radium were produced in the United States. The metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at 1200 \u00b0C. Section:Modern applications. Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered radioisotopes, such as cobalt-60 and caesium-137, are replacing radium\nDocument 4: Experimental Breeder Reactor II. more of the uranium undergoes fission, it develops fissures and the sodium enters the voids. It extracts an important fission product, caesium-137, and hence becomes intensely radioactive. The void above the uranium collects fission gases, mainly krypton-85. Clusters of the pins inside hexagonal stainless steel jackets 234 cm (92 inches) long are assembled honeycomb-like; each unit has about 4.5 kg (10 lbs) of uranium. Altogether, the core contains about 308 kg (680 lbs) of uranium fuel, and this part is called the driver. The EBR-II core can accommodate as many as 65 experimental sub-assemblies for irradiation\nDocument 5: Caesium-137. to 1 mSv above background. The most contaminated area where radiation doses are greater than 50 mSv/year must remain off limits, but some areas that are currently less than 5 mSv/year may be decontaminated, allowing 22,000 residents to return. Caesium-137 in the environment is substantially anthropogenic (human-made). Caesium-137 is produced from the nuclear fission of plutonium and uranium, and decays into barium-137. Before the construction of the first artificial nuclear reactor in late 1942 (the Chicago Pile-1), caesium-137 had not occurred on Earth in significant amounts for about 1.7 billion years.
