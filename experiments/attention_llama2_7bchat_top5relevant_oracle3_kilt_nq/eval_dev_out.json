In the words of Francis Amasa Walker, a well-known 19th-century economist, \"Money is what money does\" (\"Money is \"that\" money does\" in the original). As a medium of exchange, money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book.

Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by barter, which involves direct exchange of one good or service for another. Section:Functions of money.:Store of value. In order to be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. If money could not be stored for some period of time and still remain valuable in exchange, it would not solve the double coincidence of wants problem and therefore would not be adopted as a medium of exchange.

Section:Dilution and Dissolution. The process of dissolution and the process of dilution are closely related to each other. In both processes, similar final statuses of solutions are reached. However, the initial statuses can be different. In a dissolution process, a solute is changed from a pure phase\u2014solid, liquid, or gas\u2014to a solution phase. If the pure phase of the solute is a solid or gas (presuming the solvent itself is liquid), the process can be seen in two stages: the phase change into a liquid,\nDocument 2: Phase-change material. properties of the materials are measured and reported for comparison. Solid-liquid phase change materials are usually macro-encapsulated in the end application, so the material does not leak when in the liquid form.

Microencapsulation allows the material to remain solid, when the PCM core has melted. Section:Characteristics and classification.

Interpretation of the textual evidence of classes of slaves in ancient Egypt has been difficult to differentiate by word usage alone.

Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection.

Third Murderer The Third Murderer is a character in William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Macbeth\" (1606). He appears in one scene (3.3), joining the First and Second Murderers to assassinate Banquo and Fleance, at the orders of Macbeth. The Third Murderer is not present when Macbeth speaks to the First and Second Murderers, and is not expected by his partners. Although the Third Murderer is a small role, the identity of the character has been the subject of scholarly debate, and various productions have equated him with other characters.

In another of Shakespeare\u2019s works, \"Macbeth\", the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character. In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armour.

PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it. Epilepsy can also include transient aphasia as a prodromal or episodic symptom. Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the\nDocument 3: Aphasia. problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics). The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias. People suffering from PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence. There are three classifications of Primary Progressive Aphasia : Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), Semantic Dementia (SD), and Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the person's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them.\nDocument 4: Aphasia. Aphasia is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. This damage is typically caused by a cerebral vascular accident (stroke), or head trauma; however, these are not the only possible causes. To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or several) of the four communication modalities following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia). The four communication modalities are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication.\nDocument 5: Fast mapping. those with Broca's aphasia, who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with Wernicke's aphasia, who cannot link words with meaning.

In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca's aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation.

Computer network A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections (data links) between nodes. These data links are established over cable media such as wires or optic cables, or wireless media such as Wi-Fi. Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes are generally identified by network addresses, and can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, and servers, as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches. Two such devices can\nDocument 2: MAC address. The following network technologies use the EUI-48 identifier format: Every device that connects to an IEEE 802 network (such as Ethernet and WiFi) has a EUI-48 address. Common networked consumer devices such as PCs, smartphones and tablet computers use EUI-48 addresses. EUI-64 identifiers are used in: Section:Usage in hosts. On broadcast networks, such as Ethernet, the MAC address is expected to uniquely identify each node on that segment and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts. It thus forms the basis of most of the link layer (OSI Layer 2) networking upon which upper layer protocols rely\nDocument 3: Network switch. networked devices. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its network address, allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing the security and efficiency of the network. A switch is more intelligent than an Ethernet hub, which simply retransmits packets out of every port of the hub except the port on which the packet was received, unable to distinguish different recipients, and achieving an\nDocument 4: Routing table. In computer networking a routing table, or routing information base (RIB), is a data table stored in a router or a networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes. The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it. The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols. Static routes are entries made in a routing table by non-automatic means and which are fixed rather than being the result of some network topology \"discovery\" procedure.\nDocument 5: Virtual LAN. each use the private network ). However, it is not possible to route data between two networks with overlapping addresses without delicate IP remapping, so if the goal of VLANs is segmentation of a larger overall organizational network, non-overlapping addresses must be used in each separate VLAN.

The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and her PhD supervisor Antony Hewish using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array. Shortly after the discovery of pulsars, Franco Pacini and Thomas Gold independently suggested that pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, which form as a result of a supernova at the end of the life stars more massive than about 10 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation emitted by pulsars is caused by interaction of the plasma surrounding the neutron star with its rapidly rotating\nDocument 3: Discovery of the neutron. the neutron was too large to be a proton-electron composite, and the neutron was therefore identified as an elementary particle. Ironically, in support of Fermi's theory, Chadwick and Goldhaber predicted that a free neutron would be able to decay into a proton, electron, and neutrino (beta decay). Section:Neutron physics in the 1930s. Soon after the discovery of the neutron, indirect evidence suggested the neutron had an unexpected non-zero value for its magnetic moment. Attempts to measure the neutron's magnetic moment originated with the discovery by Otto Stern in 1933 in Hamburg that the proton had an\nDocument 4: Discovery of the neutron.

Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton. These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for this discovery.

IZUMO1 Izumo sperm-egg fusion 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IZUMO1 gene. In mammalian fertilisation, IZUMO1 binds to its egg receptor counterpart, Juno, to facilitate recognition and fusion of the gametes. Section:Function. The sperm-specific protein Izumo, named for a Japanese shrine dedicated to marriage, is essential for sperm-egg plasma membrane binding and fusion. Studies have shown that male Izumo knockout mice are sterile because their sperm are unable to fuse to the oocyte membrane.[1] Izumo -/- mice produced morphologically normal sperm that were able to penetrate the zona pellucida, but could not fuse with\nDocument 2: Fertilisation. vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of actin to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the acrosomal process. The sperm binds to the egg through another ligand reaction between receptors on the vitelline membrane. The sperm surface protein bindin, binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1. Fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. At the site of contact, fusion causes the formation of a fertilisation cone. Section:Fertilisation in animals.:Mammals. Mammals internally fertilise through copulation. After a male ejaculates, many sperm move to the\nDocument 3: Fusion mechanism. these cells must be primed to gain fusion-competence. Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid that usually resides on the inner layer of the cell membrane. After sperm cells are primed, phosphatidylserine can be found on the outer leaflet of the membrane. It is thought that this helps stabilize the membrane at the head of the sperm, and that it may play a role in allowing the sperm to enter the zona pellucida which covers egg cells. This unusual location of phosphatidylserine is an example of membrane restructuring during priming for cell fusion. Section:Mammalian Cell Fusion Mechanisms.:Chemotaxis.

Unfertilized sea urchin eggs have a negative charge inside, but the charge becomes positive upon fertilization. When sea urchin sperm encounter an egg with a positive charge, sperm-egg fusion is blocked. Thus, after the first sperm contacts the egg and causes the change, subsequent sperms are prevented from fusing. This \"electrical polyspermy block\" is thought to result because a positively charged molecule in the sperm surface membrane is repelled by the positive charge at the egg surface.

Inner core super-rotation Inner core super-rotation is a theorized eastward rotation of the inner core of Earth relative to its mantle, for a net rotation rate that is faster than Earth as a whole. A 1995 model of Earth's dynamo predicted super-rotations of up to 3 degrees per year; the following year, this prediction was supported by observed discrepancies in the time that p-waves take to travel through the inner and outer core.

Earth's inner core Earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about , which is about 20% of the Earth's radius and 70% of the Moon's radius. There are no samples of the Earth's core available for direct measurement, as there are for the Earth's mantle.

This process creates convection currents in the outer core, which are thought to be the prime driver for the currents that create the Earth's magnetic field. The existence of the inner core also affects the dynamic motions of liquid in the outer core, and thus may help fix the magnetic field. Section:Dynamics. Because the inner core is not rigidly connected to the Earth's solid mantle, the possibility that it rotates slightly more quickly or slowly than the rest of Earth has long been entertained.

Corrective lenses provide a range of vision correction, some as high as +4.0 diopter.

DNA microarray A DNA microarray (also commonly known as DNA chip or biochip) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as \"probes\" (or \"reporters\" or \"oligos\"). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called \"target\") under high-stringency\nDocument 2: DNA. held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame. In many species, only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding exons, with over 50% of human DNA\nDocument 3: Interrupted gene. Interrupted gene An interrupted gene (also called a split gene) is a gene that contains sections of DNA called exons, which are expressed as RNA and protein, interrupted by sections of DNA called introns, which are not expressed. The DNA sequence in the exon provides instructions for coding proteins. The function of the intron was not understood at first, and they were called noncoding or junk DNA. Split genes were independently discovered by Richard J. Roberts and Phillip A. Sharp in 1977, for which they shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Their discovery implied the\nDocument 4: Gene. The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.\nDocument 5: Gene. cell division. The growth, development, and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division; the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells. This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication. The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases, which \"read\" one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the template strand, and synthesize a new complementary strand. Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing, the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement;\n\n\nQuestion: the complete collection of dna and genes is called [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

Members of the denomination have also met with objection from governments for refusing to serve in the military, particularly in times of war.

Non-assembler operating systems were comparatively slow, but were easier for revision and repair. One of the reasons for the C programming language's low-level features, which resemble assembly language in some ways, is an early intent to use it for writing operating systems. Similar goals led to IBM's development of PL/S. The high-level nature of COBOL, which created some problems for operating system development, was partially addressed in BLIS, since it\nDocument 3: High-level language computer architecture. of both of these trends is the SAFE project.

Autospores are formed as a result of fission in the mitotic phase of cell division of green algae. There are multiple methods that a cell can take to form autospores. The cell can undergo a multiple fission after 2 nuclear divisions where 4 autospores will form which is the preferred mechanism in organisms such as \"P. subcapitata\". In addition to this mechanism, there is binary fission (the split into 2 autospores) also known as the \"two-autospore type\" and the \"eight-autospore type\" Section:References.

This form of asexual reproduction and cell division is also used by some organelles within eukaryotic organisms (e.g., mitochondria). Binary fission results in the reproduction of a living prokaryotic cell (or organelle) by dividing the cell into two parts, each with the potential to grow to the size of the original.\nDocument 5: Fission (biology). such that each new cell has exactly the same genetic material. More specifically, the following steps occur: Section:Binary fission.:Fission of prokaryotes.:Speed of bacterial fission. Binary fission is generally rapid though its speed varies between species. For \"E. coli\", cells typically divide about every 20 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Because the new cells will, in turn, undergo binary fission on their own, the time binary fission requires is also the time the bacterial culture requires to double in the number of cells it contains. This time period can, therefore, be referred to as the doubling time. Some species other\n\n\nQuestion: what types of cells go through binary fission [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

Today, Leibniz and Newton are usually both given credit for independently inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general physics and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of calculus was known. When Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was great controversy over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit.

In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss mathematician known for his work on the zodiacal light problem, accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton. It was not until the 1704 publication of an anonymous review of Newton's tract on quadrature, a review implying that Newton had borrowed the idea of the fluxional calculus from Leibniz, that any responsible mathematician doubted that Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton. With respect to the review of Newton's quadrature work, all admit that there was no justification or authority for the\nDocument 4: Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy. The calculus controversy (, \"priority dispute\") was an argument between the mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over who had first invented calculus. The question was a major intellectual controversy, which began simmering in 1699 and broke out in full force in 1711. Leibniz had published his work first, but Newton's supporters accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton's unpublished ideas. Leibniz died in disfavor in 1716 after his patron, the Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain in 1714. The modern consensus is that both men developed their ideas independently.\nDocument 5: Scientific priority. before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established. For example, the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century about priority in the invention of calculus. This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science. In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, priority questions are often\n\n\nQuestion: who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

This condition occurs when the lower left chamber of the heart (left ventricle) does not develop correctly. In INVM, the heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump blood efficiently. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can also occur. INVM frequently causes heart failure. Section:Clinical significance.:Cancer.

Heart development (also known as cardiogenesis) refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the \"primitive heart tube\", that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.\nDocument 5: Heart development. two separate angiogenic cell clusters form on either side and coalesce to form the endocardial tubes. As embryonic folding continues, the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days. At around 18 to 19 days after fertilisation, the heart begins to form. This early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22. The heart begins to develop near the head\n\n\nQuestion: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

A polymerase chain reaction is a form of enzymatic DNA synthesis in the laboratory, using cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA.

Although an internal ATG is the preferred site for translation initiation within the DNA ligase III open reading frame, translation initiations does also occur at the first ATG within the open reading frame, resulting in the synthesis of a polypeptide with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence.

Nuclear DNA ligase III-alpha exists\nDocument 4: DNA replication. In a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations, or origins of replication, in the genome. Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands, accommodated by an enzyme known as helicase, results in replication forks growing bi-directionally from the origin. A number of proteins are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis. Most prominently, DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands by adding nucleotides that complement each (template) strand. DNA replication occurs during the S-stage of interphase.\nDocument 5: DNA replication. in general cannot initiate synthesis of new strands, but can only extend an existing DNA or RNA strand paired with a template strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of RNA, called a primer, must be created and paired with the template DNA strand. DNA polymerase adds a new strand of DNA by extending the 3\u2032 end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new nucleotides matched to the template strand one at a time via the creation of phosphodiester bonds. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate (phosphoanhydride) bonds between\n\n\nQuestion: where does the synthesis of new dna from existing dna occurs [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

This is because minerals are most stable in the conditions closest to those under which they had formed. Simply put, the high temperature minerals, the first ones to crystallize in a mass of magma, are most unstable at the Earth's surface and quickest to weather because the surface is most different from the conditions under which they were created. On the other hand, the low temperature minerals are much more stable because the conditions at the surface are much more similar to the conditions under which they formed.

Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite, and ultra-high pressure stishovite. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is \u03b1-quartz.\nDocument 3: Water on Mars. from magma under pressures and temperatures vastly higher than conditions at the surface of a planet. When exposed to a surface environment these minerals are out of equilibrium and will tend to interact with available chemical components to form more stable mineral phases. In general, the silicate minerals that crystallize at the highest temperatures (solidify first in a cooling magma) weather the most rapidly. On Earth and Mars, the most common mineral to meet this criterion is olivine, which readily weathers to clay minerals in the presence of water. Olivine is widespread on Mars, suggesting that Mars'\nDocument 4: Sandstone. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface, as seen in Bowen's reaction series. Like uncemented sand, sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.\nDocument 5: Post-perovskite. crystal system of post-perovskite is orthorhombic, its space group is \"Cmcm\", and its structure is a stacked SiO-octahedral sheet along the \"b\" axis. The name \"post-perovskite\" derives from silicate perovskite, the stable phase of MgSiO throughout most of Earth's mantle, which has the perovskite structure. The prefix \"post-\" refers to the fact that it occurs after perovskite structured MgSiO as pressure increases (and historically, the progression of high pressure mineral physics). At upper mantle pressures, nearest Earth's surface, MgSiO persists as the silicate mineral enstatite, a pyroxene rock forming mineral found in igneous and metamorphic rocks of the crust.\n\n\nQuestion: the most stable mineral at the earth's surface [/INST]\nResponse:\n",

The answer could be elucidated as APART(HE)ID. Another common clue type is the \"hidden clue\" or \"container\", where the answer is hidden in the text of the clue itself.

Convergent boundary A convergent boundary is an area on Earth where two or more lithospheric plates collide. One plate eventually slides beneath the other causing a process known as subduction. The subduction zone can be defined by a plane where many earthquakes occur, called the Benioff Zone. These collisions happen on scales of millions to tens of millions of years and can lead to volcanism, earthquakes, orogenesis, destruction of lithosphere, and deformation. Convergent boundaries occur between oceanic-oceanic lithosphere, oceanic-continental lithosphere, and continental-continental lithosphere. The geologic features related to convergent boundaries vary depending on crust types. Plate tectonics is\nDocument 2: Radius of convergence. if and diverges if Some may prefer an alternative definition, as existence is obvious: On the boundary, that is, where |\"z\" \u2212 \"a\"| = \"r\", the behavior of the power series may be complicated, and the series may converge for some values of \"z\" and diverge for others.

The interaction of these processes can form, modify, or destroy geomorphic features on the Earth's surface. Section:Tectonic processes. The term tectonics refers to the study of the Earth's surface structure and the ways in which it changes over time. Tectonic processes typically occur at plate boundaries which are one of three types: convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, or transform boundaries. These processes form and modify the topography of the Earth's surface,\nDocument 4: Convergent boundary. Oceanic trenches are narrow topographic lows that mark convergent boundaries or subduction zones. Oceanic trenches can be average 50 \u2013 100 km wide and can be several thousand kilometers long. Oceanic trenches form as a result of bending of the subducting slab. Depth of oceanic trenches seems to be controlled by age of the oceanic lithosphere being subducted. Sediment fill in oceanic trenches varies and generally depends on abundance of sediment input from surrounding areas. An oceanic trench, the Mariana Trench, is the deepest point of the ocean at a depth of approximately 11,000 m.\nDocument 5: Eclogitization. Eclogitization Eclogitization is the tectonic process in which the high-pressure, metamorphic facies, eclogite (a very dense rock), is formed. This leads to an increase in the density of regions of Earth's crust, which leads to changes in plate motion at convergent boundaries (where rock sinks beneath other rock). Section:Relationship to slab pull.

Uniformitarianism Uniformitarianism, also known as the Doctrine of Uniformity, is the assumption that the same natural laws and processes that operate in our present-day scientific observations have always operated in the universe in the past and apply everywhere in the universe. It refers to invariance in the metaphysical principles underpinning science, such as the constancy of cause and effect throughout space-time, but has also been used to describe spatiotemporal invariance of physical laws. Though an unprovable postulate that cannot be verified using the scientific method, some consider that uniformitarianism should be a required first principle in scientific research.

He develops and argues that the earthly processes that we see in the present were the same processes as in the past and caused the Earth to look like it does today. Volume 2 builds off of the uniformitarianism theory in volume 1, but focuses more on the organic matter rather than the inorganic matter. This volume is what Darwin took with him on his voyage on the \"Beagle\". In the 3rd volume, Lyell identifies four periods of the Tertiary: Newer Pliocene, Older Pliocene,\nDocument 3: Relative dating. century. Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geologic history and the timing of geologic events. Section:Geology.:Principles of relative dating.:Uniformitarianism. The \"principle of Uniformitarianism\" states that the geologic processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geologic time. A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton, is that \"the present is the key to the past.\" In Hutton's words: \"the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be\nDocument 4: Uniformitarianism. In geology, uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that \"the present is the key to the past\" and that geological events occur at the same rate now as they have always done, though many modern geologists no longer hold to a strict gradualism. Coined by William Whewell, it was originally proposed in contrast to catastrophism by British naturalists in the late 18th century, starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton in his many books including \"Theory of the Earth\". Hutton's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\"\nDocument 5: Uniformitarianism. that come before one can do science and so cannot be tested or falsified by science. Section:History.:20th century. Stephen Jay Gould's first scientific paper, \"Is uniformitarianism necessary?\" (1965), reduced these four assumptions to two. He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.

Teeth appear lighter because less radiation penetrates them to reach the film. Dental caries, infections and other changes in the bone density, and the periodontal ligament, appear darker because X-rays readily penetrate these less dense structures.

They respond differently to light of different wavelengths, and are thus responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina.

The retina of the eye contains \"classical\" photoreceptors (\"rods\" and \"cones\"), which are used for conventional vision. But the retina also contains specialized ganglion cells that are directly photosensitive, and project directly to the SCN, where they help in the entrainment (synchronization) of this master circadian clock.

Hydrogen bonds can be intermolecular (occurring between separate molecules) or intramolecular (occurring among parts of the same molecule). Depending on the nature of the donor and acceptor atoms which constitute the bond, their geometry, and environment, the energy of a hydrogen bond can vary between 1 and 40 kcal/mol.

Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances. Liquid water's high boiling point is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low molecular mass.

This process involves the alternation between male-typical and female-typical sexual behaviours, driven by progesterone, in both lizards; corresponding to the state of their partner.

The whiptail lizard (\"A. uniparens\"), presented an opportunity to study first-hand how the neuroendocrine substrates underlying sexual behavior can evolve. In this instance, Dr. Crews used a parthenogenetic species derived from interbreeding of two sexual species. Remarkably, although the descendant species consists only of females, reproducing by obligate parthenogenesis, individuals continue to display sexual behaviors that are typical of both females and males, alternating behaviors depending upon their individual hormone profiles across reproductive cycles.

The new twin spans are located just north of the original Tappan Zee Bridge, which both run east-west over the north-south river. The new bridge's north span carries the northbound and westbound automobile traffic of Interstate 87 (I-87) and I-287; it will also carry a shared-use path for bicycles and pedestrians.\nDocument 2: Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017).

Alzheimer's disease biomarkers The Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are neurochemical indicators used to assess the risk or presence of the disease. The biomarkers can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a very early stage, but they also provide objective and reliable measures of disease progress. It is imperative to diagnose AD disease as soon as possible, because neuropathologic changes of AD precede the symptoms by years. It is well known that beta amyloid (A\u03b2) is a good indicator of AD disease, which has facilitated doctors to accurately pre-diagnose cases of AD disease.

One such marker is a beta-amyloid deposit which is a protein that deposits on the brain as we age. Although 20-33% of healthy elderly adults have these deposits, they are increased in elderly with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Additionally, traumatic brain injury, TBI, is increasingly being linked as a factor in early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease Early-onset Alzheimer's disease, also called early-onset Alzheimer's, or early-onset AD, is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed before the age of 65. It is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's, accounting for only 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases. About 13% of the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's are familial, where a genetic predisposition leads to the disease. The other incidences of early-onset Alzheimer's, however, share the same traits as the \"late-onset\" form of Alzheimer's disease, and little is understood about how it starts. Nonfamilial early-onset AD can develop in people who are in their 30s or 40s, but this\nDocument 4: Alzheimer's disease.

He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it. During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease.

These dipeptides can be formed by coupling two amino acids together by the many methods of peptide synthesis or by using the Ugi reaction of an isonitrile, amino acid, aldehyde and amine, followed by deprotection. Dipeptides substituted with an amine at one terminus and an ester at the other 1 can spontaneously cyclize to form a 2,5-diketopiperazine at a range of pHs. However, careful selection of reaction conditions is required to limit racemization.

Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome. This is not to be confused with mitosis. Mitosis also has prophase, but does not ordinarily do pairing of two homologous chromosomes. When the non-sister chromatids intertwine, segments of chromatids with similar sequence may break apart and be exchanged in a process known as genetic recombination or \"crossing-over\". This exchange produces a chiasma, a region that is shaped\nDocument 2: Synapsis. Synapsis Synapsis (also called syndesis) is the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis.

During the phase of meiosis labeled \u201cinterphase s\u201d in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so that each of the chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis (see Synapsis). During synapsis, genetic recombination usually occurs.

Synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.
