Conversely, understeer is what occurs when a car steers less than the amount commanded by the driver. Automotive engineers define understeer and oversteer based on changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration over a sequence of steady-state circular turning tests.

Seesaws also are manufactured in shapes designed to look like other things, such as airplanes, helicopters, and animals.

As well as these eye conditions, dogs of this breed may suffer from Patella luxation. Section:History. The origin of breed are unknown, however it is accepted that a type of Welsh Corgi was used to drive livestock to the north west of England from Wales.

Gwen Mackintosh began to breed Heelers in the early 1960s. Together with other enthusiasts, she established the Lancashire Heeler Club in 1978, with the club setting a breed standard and register. Recognition by The Kennel Club followed in 1981. Mackintosh would continue to serve as the club's president until her death in 1992. The breed was recognised as a vulnerable native breed by The Kennel Club in 2006, which means that annual registration figures are 300 or less for the breed. In\nDocument 5: Lancashire Heeler. Heelers were registered in the UK, in 2007 this had decreased further to 146. In 2016, the FCI added the breed to the list of provisionally accepted breeds. Section:Activities. Lancashire Heelers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lancashire Heelers exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\nQuestion: Which dog breed originates from a region farther east, the Lancashire Heeler or the Russian tracker?</s>\n<|assistant|>\n\nResponse:\n",

The majority of these species are endemic to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, especially Namaqualand, as well Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The genus name is derived from the Dutch word \"baviaan\", referring to the Chacma baboon, \"Papio ursinus\", that consumes the corms of plants in the genus. One species, \"Babiana stricta\", is widely cultivated as an ornamental.

The division of the genus into species is not completely settled. More than 30 species have been described, but many are probably just variants of these more widely accepted species: Of these, \"Ceratophyllum demersum\" is widespread, with a global distribution; the others all have more restricted ranges.

Polypodium is a genus of between 75-100 species of true ferns, widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek \"poly\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd) \"many\" + \"podion\" (\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) \"little foot\", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.\nDocument 2: Aichryson. Aichryson Aichryson is a genus of about 15 species of succulent, subtropical plants, mostly native to the Canary Islands, with a few in the Azores, Madeira and Morocco, and one in Portugal. The species of \"Aichryson\" are not frost-resistant. They are related to \"Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium\" and \"Monanthes\", readily seen in their similar flowers. The genus name comes from a contraction of the Greek \"aei\" (always) and \"chrysos\" (gold). Section:Taxonomy. Recent phylogenentic studies of Crassulaceae indicate that \"Aichryson\" is closely related to \"Monanthes\" and \"Aeonium\" (both genera are also largely endemic to the Canary Islands). Two other genera\nDocument 3: Polypodium cambricum. Polypodium cambricum Polypodium cambricum, the southern polypody, limestone polypiody, or Welsh polypody, is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae, native to southern and western Europe where it grows on shady rocks, near the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin and in the mountains of Atlantic Europe. It is a spreading, terrestrial, deciduous fern growing to tall, with pinnate fronds. The sori are yellow in winter. Section:Name. This species has been widely known by the more apt name \"P. australe\" F\u00e9e. However, since Linnaeus did mention the species, albeit in the aberrant \"cambricum\"-form, that name must have priority.\nDocument 4: Aichryson villosum. Aichryson villosum Aichryson villosum is a species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. The species occurs in the Azores and Madeira archipelagoes. The species was first described by Sabin Berthelot and Philip Barker-Webb in 1840, published in \"Natural History of the Canary Islands\". Section:Further reading.\nDocument 5: Polypodium vulgare. Polypodium vulgare Polypodium vulgare, the common polypody, is a fern of the family Polypodiaceae. \"Polypodium vulgare\" is an allotetraploid species, believed to have arisen by chromosome doubling of a sterile diploid hybrid between two ferns which are not known in Europe. The fern's proposed parents are the northern Asian and northern North American \"Polypodium sibiricum\" and western North American \"Polypodium glycyrrhiza\". Biochemical data point to a species from eastern Asia as the second possible parent. The name is derived from poly (many) and pous, podos (a foot).

The chief radium-producing countries are Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The amounts of radium produced were and are always relatively small; for example, in 1918, 13.6 g of radium were produced in the United States. The metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at 1200 \u00b0C. Section:Modern applications. Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered radioisotopes, such as cobalt-60 and caesium-137, are replacing radium\nDocument 4: Experimental Breeder Reactor II. more of the uranium undergoes fission, it develops fissures and the sodium enters the voids. It extracts an important fission product, caesium-137, and hence becomes intensely radioactive. The void above the uranium collects fission gases, mainly krypton-85. Clusters of the pins inside hexagonal stainless steel jackets 234 cm (92 inches) long are assembled honeycomb-like; each unit has about 4.5 kg (10 lbs) of uranium. Altogether, the core contains about 308 kg (680 lbs) of uranium fuel, and this part is called the driver.

Caesium-137 in the environment is substantially anthropogenic (human-made). Caesium-137 is produced from the nuclear fission of plutonium and uranium, and decays into barium-137.
