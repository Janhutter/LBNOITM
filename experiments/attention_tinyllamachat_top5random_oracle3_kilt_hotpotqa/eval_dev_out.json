Structure-based alignment programs improves the performance of these alignments and most of them are variants of the Sankoff algorithm.

Critics therefore argue that farmers do not get any of the higher price under Fairtrade. Nor is there any evidence that they get higher prices as a result of better marketing: the cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.
